#  Electric Field Visualizer

This is a simple Python tool that allows you to visualize the **electric field lines** generated by one or more point charges in 2D space.

It uses `matplotlib` to plot streamlines representing the electric field vectors and supports multiple positive or negative charges with user-defined positions.

##  How It Works

This script:
1. Prompts the user to input charges in the format:  
   `(charge in Coulombs, x position, y position)`.
2. Uses Coulombâ€™s Law to calculate the electric field at each point in a 2D grid.
3. Visualizes the resulting field using a combination of:
   - **Streamplot**: for showing field lines
   - **Quiver plot**: for showing direction vectors
   - **Red dots**: to indicate positive charges  
   - **Blue dots**: to indicate negative charges

## Physics Background

The electric field **E** due to a point charge is computed using the formula:

\[
\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q}{r^2} \cdot \hat{r}
\]

where:
- \( q \) is the charge
- \( r \) is the distance from the charge
- \( \hat{r} \) is the unit vector pointing from the charge to the field point
- \( \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space

##  Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

---

##  Usage

Run the script in a Python environment (like VSCode, Jupyter, or terminal):

```bash
python electric_field_visualizer.py
```

You will be prompted to input charges:

```
please give the values for the charge (charge(coulombs), x position, y position)
Charges (C): 1
x: 0
y: 0
Do you have more charges? y/n: y
Charges (C): -1
x: 2
y: 0
Do you have more charges? y/n: n
```

The plot will automatically appear once all charges are entered.

##  Example Output

The visual output includes:
- Field lines that flow from positive to negative charges.
- Arrow directions to indicate field orientation.
- Magnitude-based color gradients (`cool` colormap).
